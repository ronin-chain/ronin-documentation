## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to add a *finality vote key* to your profile. The finality vote key is used to vote for blocks in the [fast finality mechanism](https://github.com/axieinfinity/REPs/blob/main/REP-0003.md#rewards). If you're an active Ronin validator, you need to have this key added to have the fast finality rewards transferred to your admin address by the end of the day.

## Prerequisites

### Generate a BLS key pair

Before you add a finality vote key, you need to generate a BLS key pair. 
The BLS key pair consists of a private key and a public key. 
The public BLS key is your finality vote key. For more information, 
see the [Generate BLS key pair](/developers/nodes/validators/generate-keys.mdx) guide.

## Steps

### Step 1. Generate proof of possession

To prove that you own the finality vote key, you need to generate a proof of possession. The proof of possession is a signature of the public key using the private key.
There are two ways to generate the proof of possession: using the Ronin CLI or using the Docker image.

#### Generate using Ronin CLI

1. Ensure you have the encrypted BLS private key and password in your current directory:
   ```bash
   > tree
   .
   ├── bls_keystore
   │   └── all-accounts.keystore.json
   └── bls_password
   ```

2. Run the following command to generate the proof of possession: 
   ```bash
   ronin account generate-bls-proof
   ```

The command will return the BLS public key and the corresponding proof:
```bash
BLS public key #0: {redacted}
BLS proof #0: {redacted}
```

#### Generate using Docker image

1. In the `.env` file of your node's Docker image, add the following line:
   ```text
   GENERATE_BLS_PROOF=true
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the node:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Run the following command to view the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs node
   ```
   
The logs will return the BLS public key and the corresponding proof:

```bash
BLS public key #0: {redacted}
BLS proof #0: {redacted}
```

### Step 2. Add or change your finality vote key

**Note**: The keys you generated do not have the `0x` prefix. Before submitting the form, make sure to add the `0x` prefix to the keys.

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then go to your account, and then click **My profile**.
   <img src={profile} width={280} />

2. In the **Finality Vote Key** field, click **Add key** or the edit icon.
   <img src={addStepOne} width={400} />

3. Paste your BLS public key and the proof of possession.
   <img src={addStepTwo} width={400} />

4. Save the change and confirm the transaction.

:::info[Cooldown period]
After changing your admin address or fast finality vote key, there's a 24-hour cooldown period. During this time, you won't be able to modify either value.
