## Overview

The [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://app.roninchain.com/ccip-bridge) is a protocol developed by Chainlink to enable secure and reliable communication and token transfers between different blockchain networks. It provides the technical infrastructure for cross-chain interactions, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that operate across multiple blockchains.


## Features

1. **Cross-Chain Connectivity**  
   Enables communication and token transfers between blockchain networks, including both public and private chains.

2. **Decentralized Infrastructure**  
   Utilizes Chainlink's Decentralized Oracle Network to process and validate cross-chain messages, ensuring system reliability.

3. **Token Transfers**  
   Supports secure movement of tokens between chains, allowing for interoperability between blockchain ecosystems.

4. **Built-in Safeguards**  
   Includes security features such as rate limiting to mitigate risks associated with cross-chain interactions.
