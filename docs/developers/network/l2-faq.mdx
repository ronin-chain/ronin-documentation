description: Frequently asked questions about Ronin's Layer-2 migration
---

### ðŸ”¹ What is happening?
Ronin is migrating from a sidechain into an **Ethereum Layer-2 (L2)**. [Read the full announcement here.](https://blog.roninchain.com/p/ronins-homecoming-to-ethereum)
This transition is planned for **Q1â€“Q2 2026** and will introduce a new rewards model called **Proof of Distribution**.

### ðŸ”¹ What happens to my assets?
**No action required** for Ronin users. All assets remain secure and functional through the migration.  

### ðŸ”¹ Will users need ETH for gas?
No. **$RON remains the only gas token.**  
Ethereum settlement fees will be covered by the Ronin Treasury, not by users.

### ðŸ”¹ What are the benefits of the migration?
- **Security**: Ronin will inherit Ethereum's settlement and decentralization guarantees.  
- **Speed**: Transactions are expected to be up to **12Ã— faster**.  
- **Proof of Distribution**: A new rewards model that channels staking rewards to active builders and contributors, based on a **Builder Score**, ensuring sustainable ecosystem growth.  

### ðŸ”¹ How can I build to maximize my Builder Score?
Builder Score rewards apps that create **real value** for the Ronin ecosystem. Key factors include:  

- **On-chain activity**:  
  - Design mechanics that drive transactions and gas usage without being easily botted.  
  - Encourage healthy **NFT trading volume**, which contributes fees to the Ronin Treasury.  
  - Sustain TVL and generate protocol revenue.  

- **Off-chain activity**:  
  - Grow an engaged community of real users.  
  - Drive visibility, impressions, and cultural relevance beyond raw numbers.  

In short: put meaningful activity on-chain, avoid exploitative and bot-friendly loops, and combine strong economic flow with genuine community traction.  

### ðŸ”¹ Which Layer-2 protocol will be used?
The exact L2 protocol has not yet been finalized.  
- **Solution providers** have until **August 20** to propose their protocol.  
- **Governing Validators** will then vote on the chosen solution by **August 27**.  
- The voting timeline may be extended if further discussion is needed.

### ðŸ”¹ Are there any considerations for developers?
Yes. Faster block times may affect on-chain logic, especially apps relying on block intervals. We recommend to use `block.timestamp` instead of block numbers, since block numbers will advance more quickly after the migration.
