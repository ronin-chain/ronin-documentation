description: Generate verifivable random values using VRFs in your smart contract.
---

Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) are cryptographic functions that generate provably random outputs along with cryptographic proofs of their validity.
The proof provided by a VRF allows any participant to independently verify that the randomness was generated fairly and cannot be tampered with.
By integrating VRFs, developers can ensure that random events are both transparent and resistant to manipulation, enhancing trust and reliability in their smart contracts.

## Ronin VRF

This guide demonstrates how to request random data from the Ronin VRF (Verifiable Random Function) service in your smart contracts. The Ronin VRF service is a random number generator that provides random values that are both random and verifiable. Use cases for randomness include generating random token IDs, selecting random winners for contests, and more.

### How VRF proof is generated

- The proof is generated from the _oracle's secret key_, based on requested information that was emitted.
- The contract uses the proof with the original request information struct to recover the oracle's public key hash. This allows verification that the proof was generated by a valid oracle.
- The random seed is created based on the `gamma` field value of the `proof` struct, which is a point on the elliptic curve of the oracle's secret key. It isn't influenced by the requested info data. As long as the secret key is also generated randomly, you can treat the random seed as genuine randomness.

**Note:** It still depends on your implementation to ensure the randomness is preserved and that it's not manipulated by users.

### VRF contract addresses

The Ronin VRF Coordinator Proxy contract is deployed at the following addresses:

- Ronin mainnet: [0x16a62a921e7fec5bf867ff5c805b662db757b778](https://app.roninchain.com/address/0x16a62a921e7fec5bf867ff5c805b662db757b778)
- Saigon testnet: [0xa60c1e07fa030e4b49eb54950adb298ab94dd312](https://saigon-app.roninchain.com/address/0xa60c1e07fa030e4b49eb54950adb298ab94dd312)

## Estimate gas costs

For every randomness request, Ronin VRF charges the consuming contract a service charge of _0.01 USD (in RON)_ plus an oracle gas fee. Make sure to maintain a sufficient amount of RON so that VRF can fulfill your requests.

### Fee structure

1. A consumer contract requests randomness with specified gas amount and gas callback in the arguments. This step in our contract takes an amount of RON called `estimate_random_fee`:

```plaintext
estimate_random_fee = service_charge + fulfillment_gas_fee
```

Where:

    * `service_charge` is pegged to 0.01 USD (paid in RON).
    * `fulfillment_gas_fee` is the gas fee for the Oracle service. The amount depends on the requested arguments and includes the 500000 of gas in addition to verifying proofs and generating random seed:

    ```plaintext
    fulfillment_gas_fee = gas_price * (gas_callback + additional_gas)
    additional_gas = 500_000
    ```

    For example, if a request is sent with a callback gas amount of 250000 and the gas price of 22 GWEI (basefee * 2 + 20), the total amount the contract must pay is as follows:

    ```plaintext
    fulfillment_gas_fee = 22 GWEI * (250_000 + 500_000) = 0.015 RON
    service_charge = 0.01 USD (equivalent to 0.0025 RON at an example exchange rate of $4 per RON)
    estimate_random_fee = service_charge + fulfillment_gas_fee = 0.0175 RON
    ```

2. The oracle fulfills the random seed and refunds the remaining gas. The refund amount is less than `fulfillment_gas_fee` (0.015 RON in the preceding example).

## Steps

### Step 1. Extend VRFConsumer contract

The `VRFConsumer` contract provides a set of functions that allow a smart contract to request random data from VRF.

To extend the `VRFConsumer` contract, add the following code to your contract:

```javascript
import "./VRFConsumer.sol";

contract MyContract is VRFConsumer {
	constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) VRFConsumer(_vrfCoordinator) {}
  // your code here
}
```

### Step 2. Request randomness

Write a method that requests randomness from the VRF coordinator contract. This method should call the `_requestRandomness` function provided by the `VRFConsumer` contract and pass in the necessary parameters.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function requestRandomNumber(
	uint256 callbackGasLimit,
	uint256 gasPriceToFulFill
)
	public
	payable
	returns (bytes32 reqHash)
{
  reqHash = _requestRandomness(
		msg.value,
		callbackGasLimit,
		gasPriceToFulFill,
		msg.sender
	);
}
```

This code requests a random number by calling the `requestRandomSeed` function in the VRF coordinator contract by using the method `_requestRandomness`. It requires the following:

- The contract must have enough RON to pay the gas fee for oracle calling back. You can estimate the fee by calling `VRFCoordinator.estimateRequestRandomFee(callbackGasLimit, gasPrice)`.
- The gas amount must be determined to call back to the method `rawFulfillRandomSeed`. The amount of gas depends on the method `_fulfillRandomSeed` in the next step.
- The gas price must greater than or equal to 21 GWEI. We recommend to use `basefee * 2 + 20` GWEI.

The code then returns the request hash `reqHash` that you should store for fulfillment.

### Step 3. Fulfill randomness

Override the `_fulfillRandomSeed` function provided by the `VRFConsumer` contract. The VRF coordinator contract calls this function when it generates a random number in response to a request. The function takes the request hash and the random seed as arguments and performs any necessary actions based on the random number.

```javascript
function _fulfillRandomSeed(
  bytes32 reqHash,
  uint256 randomSeed
  )
  internal
  override
  {
    // use the random number to do something
    }
```

You can use the resultant random number to generate a random token ID or select a random winner for a contest, for example.

## Example. Mint an NFT with a random token ID

In the following example, the code implements a consumer smart contract that requests random numbers from the Ronin VRF service to mint an NFT (non-fungible token) with a randomly generated token ID.

### Step 1. Extend the VRFConsumer contract

In an example contract, `MockNFT`, extend the `VRFConsumer` contract to request random numbers from the VRF service.

```solidity
contract MockNFT is ERC721Enumerable, VRFConsumer {
  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) payable
  VRFConsumer(_vrfCoordinator)
  ERC721("MockNFT", "MNFT") {}
}
```

### Step 2. Implement the

Write a method that requests randomness from the VRF coordinator contract. This method should call the `_requestRandomness` function provided by the `VRFConsumer` contract and pass in the necessary parameters.

```jsx
/// @dev Mapping from user address => flag indicating whether user is requested
mapping(address => bool) public isUserRequested;
/// @dev Mapping from request hash => user address
mapping(bytes32 => address) public getUserByReqHash;

function requestMintRandom() external payable {
  require(!isUserRequested[msg.sender], "MockNFT: already requested");
  _requestMintRandom(msg.sender);
}

function callbackGaslimit() public pure returns (uint256) {
  return 500_000;
}

function gasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
  return 20e9 + block.basefee * 2;
}

function _requestMintRandom(address user) internal {
  bytes32 reqHash = _requestRandomness(address(this).balance, callbackGaslimit(), gasPrice(), user);
  isUserRequested[user] = true;
  getUserByReqHash[reqHash] = user;
}
```

This code does the following:

- The mappings store whether a user has already requested a random number and map the request hash to the user who made the request.
- The `requestMintRandom` function allows a user to request the minting of an NFT.
- The `_fulfillRandomSeed` method is overridden to mint the NFT with a randomly generated token ID.

  <summary>View `MockNFT` contract</summary>

```solidity
contract MockNFT is ERC721Enumerable, VRFConsumer {
  /// @dev Mapping from user address => flag indicating whether user is requested
  mapping(address => bool) public isUserRequested;

  /// @dev Mapping from request hash => user address
  mapping(bytes32 => address) public getUserByReqHash;

  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) payable VRFConsumer(_vrfCoordinator) ERC721("MockNFT", "MNFT") {}

  receive() external payable {}

  function requestMintRandom() external payable {
    require(!isUserRequested[msg.sender], "MockNFT: already requested");
    _requestMintRandom(msg.sender);
  }

  function _fulfillRandomSeed(bytes32 reqHash, uint256 randomSeed) internal override {
    uint256 tokenId = randomSeed;
    address user = getUserByReqHash[reqHash];
    if (_exists(tokenId)) {
      _requestMintRandom(user);
    } else {
      _mint(user, tokenId);
    }
  }

  function callbackGaslimit() public pure returns (uint256) {
    return 500_000;
  }

  function gasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    return 20e9 + block.basefee * 2;
  }

  function _requestMintRandom(address user) internal {
    bytes32 reqHash = _requestRandomness(address(this).balance, callbackGaslimit(), gasPrice(), user);
    isUserRequested[user] = true;
    getUserByReqHash[reqHash] = user;
  }
}
```

</details>

### Step 3. Deploy the contract

Deploy the contract to the Ronin mainnet or Saigon testnet. Make sure to fund the contract with enough RON to cover the gas fees for the VRF service. 
For deployment instructions, see the [Deploy a smart contract](/developers/smart-contracts/deploy.mdx) guide.
