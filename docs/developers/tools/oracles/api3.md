## Api3

[Api3](https://api3.org/) delivers first-party oracles that pay you.

By connecting real-world data providers directly to smart contracts, Api3 eliminates intermediaries, ensuring unmatched transparency and security. With pioneering mechanisms to recapture Oracle Extractable Value (OEV), Api3 empowers dApps with reliable data while minimizing and reclaiming the value they would otherwise leak to external actors. Api3 is redefining the oracle space by elevating oracles from mere data providers to entities that help builders retain the value they create.
