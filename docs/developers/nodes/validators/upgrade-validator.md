title: Upgrade validator version

## Overview

Upgrades are usually backwards-compatible and can contain performance
improvements, bug fixes or new features. It's recommended that every node is
upgraded as soon as possible.

An upgrade, however, can also be a hardfork, which is usually not
backwards-compatible. If your node fails to upgrade before a hardfork block
occurs, the data on your node can differ from that on the network. Therefore,
it's critical to upgrade your node before a hardfork occurs. All Ronin-planned
hardforks are announced seven days in advance on our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/roninnetwork) server and the
[Ronin Newsletter](https://blog.roninchain.com).

To upgrade your validator, please follow our [Upgrade node version](/developers/nodes/upgrade-node-version)
 guide.
