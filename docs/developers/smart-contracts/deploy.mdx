This tutorial describes how to deploy a sample smart contract on the Saigon testnet and interact with it using the [Ronin app](https://saigon-app.roninchain.com/).
Additionally, the tutorial describes how to verify a smart contract using the Ronin Sourcify service.

## Prerequisites

- A Hardhat project. If you are not familiar with Hardhat, follow the [official Hardhat tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial).
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package installation. This
  tutorial uses yarn.
- A [Ronin Wallet](https://roninchain.com/) browser extension.

## Steps

### Step 1. Install hardhat-deploy

Start with installing the `hardhat-deploy` package. This package is _required_ for deploying smart contracts on Ronin.

1. In your Hardhat project, install `hardhat-deploy` using the following command:

```bash
yarn add --dev hardhat-deploy
```

2. To enable `hardhat-deploy`, add the following line to your `hardhat.config.js` file:

```jsx
require("hardhat-deploy");
```

### Step 2. Set up the environment

To deploy your contract onto the Saigon testnet and then the Ronin mainnet, provide the network
information to Hardhat.

In the `hardhat.config.js` file, add a `networks` object with the following code:

```jsx title="hardhat.config.js"
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.28",
  // highlight-start
  networks: {
    ronin: {
      chainId: 2020,
      url: "https://api.roninchain.com/rpc",
    },
    saigon: {
      chainId: 2021,
      url: "https://saigon-testnet.roninchain.com/rpc",
    },
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

### Step 3. Set up a deployer account

To deploy the smart contract, you need a deployer account with some RON to
cover transaction gas fees.

1. In the `hardhat.config.js` file, add a `namedAccounts` object with the following code:
   ```jsx title="hardhat.config.js"
   module.exports = {
     solidity: "0.8.28",
     networks: {
       ronin: {
         chainId: 2020,
         url: "https://api.roninchain.com/rpc",
         // highlight-start
         accounts:["0xYourPrivateKey"]
         // highlight-end
       },
       saigon: {
         chainId: 2021,
         url: "https://saigon-testnet.roninchain.com/rpc",
          // highlight-start
         accounts:["0xYourPrivateKey"]
         // highlight-end
       },
     },
   };
   ```
2. Retrieve the private key in your Ronin Wallet browser extension:
   1. Open the extension, and at the top right corner, click the profile icon.
   2. Click **Manage**. You'll see a list of your accounts.
   3. Select the account from which you wish to deploy the contract, then click **View private key**, and then enter your password.
3. Copy replace `0xYourPrivateKey` with your private key.
4. Top up your Saigon testnet deployer account with RON to cover the gas fees using the [Ronin Faucet](https://faucet.roninchain.com/).

:::info
By default, the Saigon testnet network doesn't appear in Ronin Wallet. To make it visible, you need to enable it in the Ronin Wallet extension. Follow the steps in the [Accessing Saigon Testnet](https://support.roninchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/14035929237787-Accessing-Saigon-Testnet) guide.

### Step 4. Write a deployment script

1. In your project's root directory, create a sub-directory for a deployment script:
   ```bash
   mkdir deploy
   ```
2. Create a file called `1_deploy_token.js` and paste the following code:

   ```js title="1_deploy_token.js"
   const func = async function (hre) {
     const { deployments, getNamedAccounts } = hre;
     const { deploy } = deployments;

     const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

     await deploy("Token", {
       from: deployer,
       args: [],
       log: true,
     });
   };
   module.exports = func;
   func.tags = ["Token"];
   ```

### Step 5. Deploy the contract on the Saigon testnet

Now that you have set up the environment, you can deploy your smart contract on the Saigon testnet.

1. To deploy your contract, run the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn hardhat deploy --network saigon
   ```

   Setting the `--gasprice` flag explicitly is required to work around the issue with the provider used by Hardhat ignoring the gas price set in `hardhat.config.js`. Make sure that you installed the required `hardhat-deploy` package in [Step 1](#step-1-install-hardhat-deploy).

   You should see output with the deployed address similar to this:

   ```bash
   deploying "Token" (tx: 0x6a3ecf86a07cbde9505bdfc233b9949a276ee54c04bc52269c161e9aad128d8b)...: deployed at 0x2D7b763d4A86dd105d8878f31993c7995e9261A1 with 686956 gas
   âœ¨  Done in 16.14s.
   ```

2. Copy the contract address. In the preceding example, our contract address is `0x2D7b763d4A86dd105d8878f31993c7995e9261A1`.
3. Open the [Saigon testnet explorer](https://saigon-app.roninchain.com/) and paste your contract address in the search field.

4. To view your contract, select it in the list.

### Step 6. Verify the contract using Ronin Sourcify

Although this step is optional, verifying your smart contract and publishing its
source code can build trust for your app. Ronin uses the Sourcify service to
make this task easier.

1. To publish the source code of your contract to Sourcify, run the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn hardhat --network saigon sourcify --endpoint https://sourcify.roninchain.com/server
   ```

2. In the [Saigon testnet explorer](https://saigon-app.roninchain.com/), search for your contract, then select the **Contracts** tab, and then notice the green checkmark. The checkmark indicates that your contract is successfully verified.
