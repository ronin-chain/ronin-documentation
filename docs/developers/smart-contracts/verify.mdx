Verifying a smart contract is a crucial step to ensure the integrity and security of the Ronin network.
The verification involves inspecting the contract's source code to ensure that it is bug-free, secure, and will perform as expected.
We encourage the contract deployers to verify their contract by submitting the source code and metadata to our internal [Sourcify](https://sourcify.roninchain.com/) service.

## Verify using Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.
hardhat-deploy is a deployment plugin for Hardhat that helps you automate the deployment of your smart contracts.

With hardhat-deploy, you can verify the source code of your smart contract using the following methods:

- Using the CLI
- Using the deployment script

### Option 1. Using the CLI

If your smart contract project uses `hardhat-deploy` as a dependency,
specify the endpoint and network before verifying by
using the `hardhat sourcify` command:

```bash
hardhat sourcify --endpoint https://sourcify.roninchain.com/server/ --network <ronin>
```

:::note
Do not drop the trailing slash `/` in the endpoint URL.
:::

For more information, see [hardhat-sourcify](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#5-hardhat-sourcify).

### Option 2. Using the script

1. Save the following script to `deploy/verify-contract.ts`.

```ts title="deploy/verify-contract.ts" showLineNumbers
import { TASK_SOURCIFY } from "hardhat-deploy";
import { network } from "hardhat";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";

const deploy = async (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  if (network.name == "ronin" || network.name == "saigon") {
    await hre.run(TASK_SOURCIFY, {
      endpoint: "https://sourcify.roninchain.com/server",
    });
  }
};

deploy.tags = ["VerifyContracts"];
deploy.runAtTheEnd = true;

export default deploy;
```

1. Include this script in the actual deployment script's dependencies. For example:

```ts title="deploy/sample-contract.ts"
deploy.dependencies = ["VerifyContracts"];
```

## Verify using Foundry

Foundry is a command-line tool that helps you verify the source code of your smart contract on the Ronin network.

To verify your smart contract using Foundry, follow these steps:

1. Install Foundry by following the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
1. Run the following command:

```bash
forge verify-contract --verifier sourcify --verifier-url https://sourcify.roninchain.com/server/ --chain-id <CHAIN> <ADDRESS> <CONTRACT>
```

Replace the following placeholders with the actual values:

    * `<CHAIN>`: The chain to which the contract is deployed, such as `2020` for the Ronin mainnet or `2021` for the Saigon testnet.
    * `<ADDRESS>`: The address of the smart contract.
    * `<CONTRACT>`: The path to the contract in the format `<path>:<contract>`, such as `src/SampleContract.sol:SampleContract`.

You should see output similar to this:

```bash
Start verifying contract `0xADDRESS` deployed on 2021

Submitting verification for [SampleContract] "0xADDRESS".
Contract successfully verified
```

For the full list of options you can use with the `forge-verify-contract` command, see the [forge verify-contract documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract).

## Verify using Sourcify UI

### Step 1. Locate smart contract metadata

Smart contract's metadata is automatically generated by the Solidity compiler in the
form of a `.json` file. It contains information about the compiled smart contract.
The metadata is located in different locations depending on the tool you use to
compile smart contracts.

#### Solidity compiler contract metadata

1. If you use [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/installing-solidity.html)
   for compiling, then to print out the contract's metadata, run the following command:

```bash
solc <CONTRACT>.sol --metadata
```

Replace `<CONTRACT>` with the name of the contract file.

You should see output similar to this:

```solidity
======= Token.sol:Token =======
Metadata:
{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"_from","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"_to","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"_value","type":"uint256"}],"name":"Transfer","type":"event"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"balanceOf","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"name","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"owner","outputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"symbol","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"totalSupply","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"to","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"transfer","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{"balanceOf(address)":{"notice":"Read only function to retrieve the token balance of a given account. The `view` modifier indicates that it doesn't modify the contract's state, which allows us to call it without executing a transaction."},"constructor":{"notice":"Contract initialization."},"transfer(address,uint256)":{"notice":"A function to transfer tokens. The `external` modifier makes a function *only* callable from *outside* the contract."}},"version":1}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"Token.sol":"Token"},"evmVersion":"shanghai","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"Token.sol":{"keccak256":"0xa79117cae1147d7d93c6e5653e26d2ce4a6669f211a7de27ffc2ac61c57a115b","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://1b28ac474b44450104fc99400a70947517e0869274a3537c9d0ea8047d7b8146","dweb:/ipfs/QmYreFmttckn7Mru8z1oe89sVbWVUBd2WxvX8w12yreaFF"]}},"version":1}
```

1. Copy the JSON object starting at `{”compiler”:...` to a new file and save it as `metadata.json`.
1. Upload your `metadata.json` file and the source code of your contract in the `.sol` format to [Sourcify](https://sourcify.roninchain.com/).

#### Hardhat contract metadata

If you use Hardhat for compiling your smart contract, then after running the
`hardhat compile` command,
you can find the metadata file in the `artifacts/build-info` directory.
Hardhat includes the source code in the metadata file. You can upload just this
`.json` file to [Sourcify](https://sourcify.roninchain.com/).

### Step 2. Submit information

1. After you find the metadata and source code, upload them to [Sourcify](https://sourcify.roninchain.com/). If your files are valid, a contract's details form is displayed on the right side of the page.
1. To complete the verification process, fill out the smart contract address and
   select the chain to which it is deployed.

When verification is complete, a `Verification successful!` message appears (pictured).
