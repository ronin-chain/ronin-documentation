## Overview

The RON token is the ecosystem token for the Ronin blockchain which enables you to pay for transactions on Ronin and participate in securing the network via staking to validators.
There are several ways to purchase RON and other tokens on Ronin. You can purchase them through a centralized exchange (CEX), On-ramp solutions, and a decentralized exchange (DEX).

## Set up Ronin Wallet

To store, trade, and receive the RON token, you need Ronin Wallet. For setup instructions, see [Get started with the Ronin Wallet mobile app](https://support.roninchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/14037076528283-Getting-Started-on-Ronin-Mobile-Wallet).

## Acquire RON from a CEX

A CEX is a business that allows you to buy RON
with traditional currency. After purchasing RON from a CEX, you can then send it back to your Ronin Wallet to enjoy
Ronin dApps. Centralized exchanges can be restricted in certain
geographical locations, and applicable fees differ among exchanges.

Here's a list of exchanges that support RON:

* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/)
* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
* [OKX](https://www.okx.com/)
* [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/spot/RONIN_USD)
* [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/trade/RON_USDT)
* [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/spot/RONUSDT)
* [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/RON_USDT)
* [Coins.ph](https://pro.coins.ph/en-ph/trade/RON/PHP/)

## Acquire RON from On-ramp providers

Ronin has the following official On-ramp partners:

* [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy)
* [OnMeta](https://onmeta.in/buytoken)

You can purchase RON either in the Ronin Wallet mobile app or in your browser:

* Download Ronin Wallet for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ronin-wallet/id1592675001) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skymavis.genesis&hl=en_US&gl=US), then sign in and go to **dApps > Purchase**.
* Visit [purchase.roninchain.com](http://purchase.roninchain.com/)

## Acquire RON using Katana

[Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) is the official DEX supported on Ronin. 
It allows you to exchange RON for other tokens in the Ronin ecosystem (such as AXS and SLP) using existing
liquidity pools provided by the community. Katana is powered by smart
contracts, which means there are fewer geographical restrictions.

To use Katana, you need to acquire digital assets on Ronin. There are two ways to do that:

* Withdraw your assets from a CEX, such as Binance or Coinbase, to Ronin.
* Transfer your assets from Ethereum to Ronin using Ronin Bridge. For more information, see [Deposit ERC-20 tokens using Ronin Bridge](../apps/ronin-bridge/guides/deposit-token.md).

## Bridge and swap

You can also use other tools, such as 

* [Gas.zip](https://www.gas.zip/)
* [Layerswap.io](https://layerswap.io/app/)
* [Relay.link](https://www.relay.link/bridge/ronin)
* [SideShift.ai](https://sideshift.ai/eth/ron)
* [StealthEX.io](https://stealthex.io/exchange/new/?to=ron)

to swap your tokens on other chains and acquire RON on Ronin.
